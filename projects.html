            <h3>Attendance using Face Recognition</h3>
            <p>
                Implemented a Python project to automate attendance management using open-cv and face recognition
                modules. The system utilizes facial recognition to efficiently track attendance and facilitates automatic
                email reports to faculty members.

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Customer Churn Prediction</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a predictive model using a random forest classifier to identify customers at risk of subscription
                cancellation. The model's analysis of customer data enabled data-driven decisions for enhancing customer
                retention strategies.

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Air Quality Index Prediction (Course Project | Under Prof. Srinivas)</h3>
            <p>
                Led the development of a predictive model to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) for specific locations.
                Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model provides accurate AQI predictions and is deployed on
                Heroku (PaaS) for real-time accessibility.

            <h3>Breast Cancer Prediction Using Deep Learning (Research Paper | Prof. Prasanna Priya)</h3>
            <p>
                Published a research paper in JOICS highlighting a comparative analysis of various machine learning
                algorithms. Identified the best deep learning algorithm, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with Adam
                optimizer, to predict breast cancer with an impressive 98% accuracy. The research significantly
                contributes to medical diagnostics.
